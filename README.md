# Cash-Ratio-Optimization

Last month, I joined the BRI Hackathon organized by BRI with two of my friend The use case that I choose was about Cash Ratio Optimization. In the Cash Ratio Optimization use case, we as a participant were asked to build a Machine Learning model that could provide  cash management recommendations accurately, so that it was expected to reduce  operational costs and reduce the loss of BRI business opportunities in using cash. Our task was to predict kas_kantor and kas_echannel values for 31 days ahead. To solve this use case, my team used prophet model to predict kas_kantor and kas_echannel value. I believe that the model which we created needs a lot of improvement, or there is another model that more suitable for the data.
